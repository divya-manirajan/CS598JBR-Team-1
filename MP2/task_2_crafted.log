    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.
    assert words_string("") == []
    assert words_string("ahmed     , gamal") == ["ahmed", "gamal"]
```

This code will test the `words_string` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

You are an AI programming assistant for generating pytest unit tests for Python programs. Please perform the following steps to write pytest code. Do not write any explanations of the pytests. Only write Python code and comments. Do not write any other text. Put your output after ###python_pytests.

Step 1. Read the ###given program in the carefully to understand what it does, the data type of the input, and the execution flow.
Step 2. Look at the ###example_tests I have given you to use as a starting point.
Step 3. Generate as many additional pytest tests for the ###given program. Generate at least 10 additional tests.
Step 4. Check your tests to make sure they cover all possible execution paths.
Step 5. Create additional tests for any uncovered execution paths from step 4.

Reminder: do not write any explanations of the pytests. Only write Python code and comments. Do not write any other text.

### Instruction:
I'm an AI programming assistant. I'm here to help you with your programming tasks. I'm currently working on a project where I need to create a function that will return the number of days between two dates.

Here is the function I have so far:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def days_between_dates(date1, date2):
    date1 = datetime.strptime(date1, "%d-%m-%Y")
    date2 = datetime.strptime(date2, "%d-%m%Y")
    return abs((date2 - date1).days)
```

The problem is with the second date format. It seems to be incorrect. Can you help me fix it?

I'm also looking for a way to improve this function. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help.
